# AI Contenxt

## Requirement: Create context Data
To enhance the AI context structures I would like a scheduled job that walks through the files and folders and adds data to the aicontext folder. 

## Detailed
 - Please create a scheduled job that runs every 5 mins.
 - The job should check the ai is configired and ready to be used.
 - The job should look through the .aicontext hidden folder and check if the folder-context.md file exists, if it doesnt then the job should pass look at the folder and ask the ai to create context based on the folder name and its contents what the purpose is and add it to the folder-context.md.
 - The job should look through the files in the folder and check if there is a {filename}-context.md file in the .aicontext folder. If there is not a file and the file is text based (md, txt, code file), the folder should pass the content of the file to the ai as have it explain the context of the file and save it to {filename}-context.md.
