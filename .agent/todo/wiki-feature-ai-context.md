# AI Contenxt

## Requirement: Create context layout
So I would like to make a cool feature that works with the ai chat. So this is what I need, for every folder create a folder called .aicontext that allows me to capture context about a certain folder or file. Then on the AI assistant allow me to switch the chat view to a context view that shows me all the file in the .aicontext folder and I can click on the file and it allows me to edit a context.md file. This file should open in the content editor so I have the value of this editor.
