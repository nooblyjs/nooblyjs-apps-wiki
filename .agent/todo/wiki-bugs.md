## Save File actions
- [x] Can you please update the save file action to save the file, show a alert that the file was saved to reset to the view in the content menu.
- [x] Can you possibly create a timer that periodically (every 1 minute) save the content of the file I am editing. Note this should not close the file but just indicate when the file was last saved.
