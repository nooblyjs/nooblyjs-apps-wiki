## System Performance Review

### Current Metrics
- **API Response Time**: Average 150ms (target: <200ms) ✅
- **Database Query Time**: Average 45ms (target: <100ms) ✅
- **Memory Usage**: 65% average (target: <80%) ✅
- **CPU Usage**: 40% average (target: <70%) ✅

### Performance Issues Identified
1. **Search Service**: Complex queries taking >500ms
2. **Image Processing**: Thumbnail generation bottleneck
3. **Cache Hit Ratio**: 78% (target: >85%)

### Action Items
