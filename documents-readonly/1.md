# Microservices Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of our microservices architecture, including design principles, service boundaries, and communication patterns.

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each microservice should have a single, well-defined responsibility that aligns with business capabilities.

### 2. Autonomy
Services should be independently deployable and maintainable, with minimal external dependencies.

### 3. Decentralization
Avoid centralized data management and governance. Each service manages its own data.

## Service Architecture

```javascript
// Example service structure
class UserService {
  constructor() {
    this.database = new UserDatabase();
    this.eventBus = new EventBus();
  }

  async createUser(userData) {
    const user = await this.database.create(userData);
    await this.eventBus.publish('user.created', user);
    return user;
  }
}
```

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- REST APIs for request-response patterns
- GraphQL for flexible data fetching

### Asynchronous Communication
- Event-driven messaging for loose coupling
- Message queues for reliable processing

## Best Practices

1. **API Versioning**: Always version your APIs to maintain backward compatibility
2. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers to handle service failures gracefully
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics collection
4. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization at the service level

## Conclusion

Following these architectural principles ensures our microservices are scalable, maintainable, and resilient.
