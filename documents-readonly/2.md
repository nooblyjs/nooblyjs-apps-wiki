# User Authentication Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all client applications in our ecosystem.

## Functional Requirements

### Primary Authentication
- Username/email and password combination
- Password strength requirements (minimum 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Support for TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- SMS-based verification codes
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Backup codes for account recovery

### Session Management
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Secure session storage
- Single sign-on (SSO) across applications

## Security Requirements

### Data Protection
- All passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with salt
- Personal information encrypted at rest
- Secure transmission over HTTPS only

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance for European users
- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- Regular security audits

## User Experience Requirements

### Login Flow
1. User enters credentials
2. System validates and prompts for MFA
3. User provides second factor
4. System grants access with appropriate session

### Error Handling
- Clear, user-friendly error messages
- No information disclosure about account existence
- Progressive delays for repeated failures

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  mfa_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  mfa_secret VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Endpoints
- POST /auth/login - Primary authentication
- POST /auth/mfa/verify - MFA verification
- POST /auth/refresh - Token refresh
- POST /auth/logout - Session termination

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can log in with email/password
- [ ] MFA can be enabled/disabled by users
- [ ] Account lockout prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] Sessions expire appropriately
- [ ] All authentication events are logged
